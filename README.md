I enjoy taking ideas from early requirements all the way to delivery — organizing tasks, structuring workflows, and building the front-end features that bring products to life.

- 🎓 **Computer Science @ CESAR School**  
- 📊 **Agile Project Management:** Scrum, Kanban, Lean, backlog management, documentation  
- 🧭 **Project Coordination:** timelines, RACI matrix, task delegation, Notion organization, stakeholder communication  
- 💻 **Front-end Development:** React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML/CSS  
- 🧠 **Strategic Skills:** market research, SWOT, PESTLE, Business Model Canvas, Lean Canvas  
- 🌎 **Native English Speaker**

I thrive in collaborative teams where clarity, structure, and continuous improvement guide the workflow.
